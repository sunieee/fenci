Ifyou
are
tired
of
the
feminine
gender
in
American
librarywork
just
come
to
China.Here
the
men
take
the
lead
in
librarywork.Our
senior
class
is
all
men
the
junior
class
is
equallydivided
between
men
and
women.The
students
are
well
worth
atrip
across
the
Pacific.They
are
attractive
both
as
students
andas
friends.
Eager
and
industrious
they
make
teaching
a
joy.Teas
games
and
work
together
have
made
us
so
familiar
with
theChinese
paudze
and
the
Western
dress
thatweforget
any
differencein
race
until
an
occasional
funny
pronunciation
recalls
it.Many
agood
laugh
we
have
had
over
failure
to
understand
each
other
sspeech.For
the
most
part
they
speak
English
quite
easily
and
itis
worth
noting
that
their
lectures
in
English
subjects
are
giventhem
entirely
in
English.Their
course
of
study
includes
the
usualEnglish
standards
of
library
economy
cataloging
classification
reference
work
bibliography
and
book
selection
but
here.the
lastfour
courses
must
be
studied
both
forEnglish
and
for
Chinesebooks.
the
Western
courses
have
been
adapted
to
the
needs
of
China.Cultu-ral
study
and
practical
work
go
hand
in
hand.In
our
library
schoolsthe
students
must
have
had
French
and
Gerrman
before
they
enter.Here
they
must
have
had
English
before
they
enter
and
they
arerequired
to
take
French
and
German
along
with
their
library
work.Ample
provision
is
made
for
practical
experience
in
every
line.Books
are
mended
and
rebound
and
practice
work
accompaniesevery
course.For
outside
experience
the
students
are
sent
out
todomissionary.work
with
traveling
libraries
and
to
work
out
libraryprojects
for
other
libraries
and
schools.Here
they
have
typewriting
book-keeping
accounting
filing
and
administration
of
archives
andChinese
metal
and
stone
inscriptions
which
we
do
not
haveat
allin
our
library
schools
in
America.From
time
to
time
the
libraryschool
hears
lectures
from
leading
scholars
from
the
vicinity
andfrom
other
universities.
Along
with
all
this
must
be
care
forphysical
well-being
that
these
scholars
of
China
shall
be
strongandenduring.The
Government
requires
military
training
and
the
Schooladds
track
and
field
games
and
Chinese
boxing.Could
there
beamore
well
rounded
curriculum
Could
any
more
be
crowded
intothe
time
No
doubt
the
students
will
agree
that
it
takes
superiorpeople
to
excel
in
so
much
work.Our
library
schools
in
Americado
not
offer
such
a
variety.One
is
tempted
to
say
that
onlyChinese
students
could
carry
such
heavy
courses.Asfor
