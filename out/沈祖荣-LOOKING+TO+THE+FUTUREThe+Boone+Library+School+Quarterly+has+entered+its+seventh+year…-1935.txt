The
Boone
Li
brary
School
Quarterl
y
has
entered
i
ts
seventh
year.Compared
with
such
professional
journals
as
the
Library
Journaland
the
Library
Association
Record
that
have
enjoyed
a
long
lifeof
oyer
fifty
years
our
Quarterly
is
still
in
its
infancy.In
readingthe
back
files
of
those
periodicals
one
can
follow
the
history
anddevelopment
of
library
service
in
America
and
England.Theirlibrarians
with
long
years
of
experience.These
librarians
recordedtheir
successes
and
failures
for
the
benefit
of
their
fellow
workersand
inspired
many
propsective
young
librarians.
In
a
word
libra-rians
of
those
early
days
educated
their
public
quite
as
much
asthey
helped
those
in
the
library
profession.Looking
back
over
our
own
little
Quarterly
we
see
it
has
plentyof
shortcomings.Many
more
years
will
have
to
pass
before
it
canbe
a
periodical
of
real
worth.One
thing
we
are
certain
of.Weare
not
competing
with
any
otherprofessional
journals.Our
Quarterly
serves
only
as
a
mouthpiece
to
voice
the
opinions
of
youngChinese
would-be
librarians.Our
main
aim
in
publishing
this.Quarterly
is
to
introduce
the
American
and
English
library
systemsand
transplant
them
to
our
own
country.Ifwe
have
notyetcreativeability
along
this
line
we
should
have
their
methods
and
ideas
forlibrary
work.That
is
the
reason
why
every
issue
of
the
BooneLibrary
School
Quarterly
contains
one
or
two
translations
from
arti-cles
written
by
foreign
librarians.It
is
also
our
hope
that
throughthese
pages
we
may
transmit
our
ideas
and
experiences
in
Librarywork
to
our
fellow
wopkers
abroad.They
will
see
our
limitationsbecause
our
small
number
have
not
only
to
teach
but
to
do
administrative
work
as
well.We
can
not
give
the
time
to
research
thatwe
should
like
to
give
but
we
have
the
hearty
cooperation
of
ouralumni
and
students
who
are
still
under
training.They
are
imbuedwith
the
desire
to
use
their
leisure
hours
for
translating.We
are
glad
to
see
that
our
Quarterly
has
not
only
won
a
place
for
itselfin
China
but
has
also
won
recognition
abroad.This
is
seen
in
theway
it
brings
back
to
us
many
valuable
exchanges.In
all
these
years
we
have
never
published
an
English
department
except
in
that
one
Special
Number
published
inmemoryof
MissMary
E.Wood
the
founder
of
the
Library
and
Library
School.That
was
in
when
she
entered
into
eternal
rest.The
editorialBoard
now
recognizes
the
need
for
an
English
article
in
each
issue.We
hope
thus
to
integrate
our
professional
ideas
with
those
oflibrary
workers
who
can
not
read
our
language.Beginning
withthis
issue
we
plan
that
each
number
shall
henceforth
have
one
ortwo
articles
in
English.This
will
afford
another
opportunity
toour
alumni
who
write
in
English
at
the
same
time
that
it
makesthe
Boone
Library
School
Quraterly
better
known
in
the
libraryworldatlarge.Ioffer
these
brief
statements
as
our
reason
for
now
turningaside
form
our
beaten
path.From
our
graduates
I
solicit
theirour
small
funds
we
can
offer
no
pay.What
the
students
do
forthe
Quarterly
must
be
in
a
sacrificial
spirit.Itis
indeed
gratifyingthat
they
do
give
such
loyal
service.Without
it
the
Quarterlywould
long
ago
have
come
to
an
end.As
Director
of
the.School
I
take
this
opportunity
to
extend
to
them
one
and
all
our
deepappreciation
of
their
generous
assistance.Also
to
the
China
foundation
for
the
Promotion
of
Education
ahd
Culture.The
onlyfinancial
support
that
Quarterly
has
comes
from
this
Foundation.To
its
trustees
we
offer
our
deep
gratitude
for
the
provision
thatmakes
this
publication
possible.Suggestions
and
criticisms
for
the
improvement
of
the
Quar-terly.are
always
welcome.Samuel
