Quite plainly the case is thatthe protection which is accorded toShanghai bythe taxpayers of Europe and America is soldbythe landlords in Shanghai particularly to Chinesetentants in the form of protection. Until re-cent years this protection really was existent butfor all practical purposes it doesnot exist to-dayalthough it is a remarkable fact that in the mindsof the average Chinese in Shanghai it still existsand this despite the Japanese onslaughtonHongkew two years ago and the fact that high-way robberies and burglaries are almost dailyfeatures of life in the International Settlementto-day. Even in a political sense thereeis atpresent no protection for Chinese in the Inter-national Settlement. With the Chinese courtsabsolutely in Chinese hands the Chinese Govern-ment can at any time lay hands on any Chineseresident it wishes and no foreign authority of anykind will say it nay.One of the peculiar features of the Shanghaitaxing system a refex of its British control is thatrenters of premises and not owners of land bearthe principal burden of taxation.The land own-ing class at the very beginning of the Settlement sexistence saw to it that there should be no change as against the landlords in the ratio of taxationbetween the two classes of residents-a stipulationto this effect being inserted in the Land Regula-With such a background it is not to betions.wondered at that the land-owning class with smugassurance will express-the opinion that it is to behoped that the authorities will stop the agitationfor lower rents or else there are likely tobegrave consequences.We are among those whobelieve that the principal grave consequences of the present agitation to secure cheaper rentalswill be that in future dividends of land companieswill have to be reduced.The Shanghai Water-works Co. wisely reduced its rates and Shanghailandlordswill webelieve bewise to follow suitnot that there is likely to be looting or rioting asa result of continued high rents but because moreand more tenants will either be unable or willrefuse to pay the rents as has been the case forexample with many on Nanking road.The annual meeting of the Asia Life Insurance Asia Life Pays 35 Percent Dividend 1.00 per share was ordered making 35 for the year .The total profit for the year was 492 661.90. THE CHINA WEEKLY REVIEW BY CHIH-BER KWEI Ph.D. 桂質相 Director National Central University Library Nanking AFTER a lapse of nearly four hundred years theChinese public have once more become interested inone of China s outstanding private librariesthe TienYi Kuo Library at Ningpo Chekiang.The origin of this library can be traced to Fan Chin also known as Fan Yao-chin 1506-1585 who graduatedas chin shih in 1532 and was appointed to be the magistrateof Siu Chou.

Furthermore he wrote on the edges of the leaves of each book the dateof its arrival.After his death he willed that the wholecollection be given to one of his sons in order not toscatter its contents.Judging from the present standpoint this privatelibrary is remarkable in several ways.One feature is thatthis library containssmany rare and valuable books thatno other library of its nature may compare.This hasbeen clearly shown by the fact that towards the end of18th century Emperor Ch ien Lung wished to possesstheevery single book known at that time.
