*MISSMARYELIZABETHWOODThe Queen of the Modern Library Movement in China
General Li Ytan Hung,late President of the Republicof China,once calledMiss Wood,the founder of the Boone Library and Director of the Library by theabove title.It was in 1926,when she went to see him in his mansion in Tientsinin the interest of lbrary movement in this Country. By this remark made by him,General Li consciously or unconsciously voiced the sentiment of Chinese librarians,for we all feel that to her and to her alone we owe the ideals,enthusiasm,andguidance which have brought success to the library movement in Chins.If welook around now,we see libraries established in many cities where none existedbefore,or,at most, there were only collections of books.Her untiring effortsbrought a change in our conception of the library instead ofa place where books arestored to a living organization.It will bring satisfaction to her and to the Missionthat sent her out to this land to know that most of the libraries are now administeredbyyoung men andyoungwomen who have been either trainedorinspiredby herIt is impossible to overestimate all she did for the Boone Library and the LibrarySchocl,and all she accomplished for the Library Movement the torch of inspiration,library spirit, and personal sacrifice which she passed on to her pupils andfellow-librarians. It was like a shining light which went out from her into thedarkcornersofourCountry.We remember vividlywhen Miss Wood first came to Boone School-thirty-still a power in this Diocese,soon after the old system of examinations had justpassed, and the so-called ‘new learning”was being introduced.As a missionary，she was very muchinterested in this educational move,and thought that through theavenue of books,the mission she represents, could be of the widest service.could very well see the birght prospect for Boone at that time,and also the needofa library.The founding of acollegiate department in 1903:made the needmore imperative.Although she had many hours of teaching.yet she at oncecommenced to do library work among the students.Her interest in this workgrew,and she wroteletters to her friends,Women’sAuxiliaries,and the ChurchPeriodical Club in America for help in the form of books and money.A smallcollection of books was gathered together and placed in a small room-the oldfamiliar Octagon oa the campus-most inadequate even for our own students,but

she did not lose sight of her vision of a library building.On her first furlough shedevoted her time and energy to the interesting of friends of China in Americain the erecting of a Library Building at Boone.Many public-spirited and Christianmen and women on the other side of the Pacific, caught her vision and contributedfunds towards making herdream come true. Dr. Seth Low,late President ofColumbia University,was the frst donor.Miss Olivia Phelps Stokes,avery well.known New York phileuthopist,gave money for the auditorium in memory of hersister,which is called Stokes Hall after her. Many friends in Boston, BishopLawrence,and his two sisters Mrs.Rrederick Cunningham and Mrs.Loring, MissMarian Dec Ward,and Miss Sturgis;and,in Philadelphia,Mrs.Charles Biddle,andMrs. John Markoe;and certain ones in Baltimore and Richmond helped to makethe building possible.During the intervening years books were constantly comingfrom the Women's Auxiliaries and the Church Periodical Club.The building,with its furnishings,represents the gifts of many devoted andinterested friends of China far and wide in the Church in America. AlthoughGiecian in its architecture,Miss Wood tried to combine with Chinese art whichshe loved,in its interior decorations and furnishings, that we Chinese people mightsee at once that the building was for us,and might feel at home there.This isevident,even before we enter,from the inscriptions in Chinese from our great SageConfucius over the main door-way.We know too what the structure stands far,in the center in Chinese, are the words,In Christ are hidden all the treasures andknowledge.These inscriptions are carved in granite and covered with gold andshine out for all passers-by to see.Many Chinese hand carvings on the partitionsand the bracketsat the top of the massive pillars,on railings and windows make afavorableimpression upon visitors,as works of art, But while we appreciate thebeautiful building and its exquisite carvings,we must not forget-the works shedid,and the trials she endured with carpenters and masons,whilethe building wasin the process of construction.In the springof 1910 the Library was formally opened.Manyhighofficialsoutside the walls of Boone.When Miss Wood first dreamed of a Public Librarythat could be of servicein theWuhan cities,shedid not forsetheobstacles beforeher,She thought the public would certainly fock into it whenthe library openedits doors.Her hopes that students would welcome suchaprivilege were shatteredthat frst year.The great dificulty has been to bring the stndents of outsideschools to Boone Library for reading.Repeated efforts have been made,but with

little success.
This was owing to long hours and fixed rules of the government
schools,and to the fact that Boone is some distance from the center.This methodof circulating books failed.Then Miss Wood thought of a better plan and carriedit out.It was the introduction of University Extension Leetures.IBefore attempting ubiversity extension work personal visits were made toall the leading educational insitutions in the City, to ascertain what their attitudewould be toward it.She began tocall onthe principals of thegovernment schoolsandtelling them how the Boone Library planned to give University Extension Lectureson scientific,social and literary subjects during the fall and spring terms.Accordingly she sent tickets to the various schools andpublic institutions in advance,thenumber of tickets being in proportion to the number of students in that particnlarschool.Every lectufe course began with a concert.By means of these lecturescommunity with regard to public health,good government, natural science, etc.Many of these lectures were illustrated with lantern slides and educational filmsTwo reading rooms have been openedin.connection with the Boone LibraryOne is at St.Michael's Church.Thatis frequented by citizens of that guarter,military and other students,policemen,etc.The other,at Trinity Church,isvery flourishing.The readers are most merchants and shopkeepers.These tworeading rooms have been of special service to the parishioners andresidents ofthose sections:Thirough the avenue of reading rooms theBoone Library is ableto do not only educational work, but also evangelistic work among tbese leadingclassesofthepeople.At our home base when the Boone Library was frst opened in 1910, MissWood aimed principally to work with students,as Wuchang has always been acity of schools.After fruitless attempts to get students from the governmentschools, she changed her tactics.She again visited the principals of the governmentschoolsandput the suggestion to them thatbooks should bebroughtto theirdoors.The plan was favorably received.Not only were travelling libraries sentto the government schools and mission schools in the city,but also tosome publicinstitutions, like the Hanyang Irou and Steel Works, Canton Hankow Railway，Yang Tze Engineering Works,etc. Sometimes they went to far away places onthe Yang Tze-Wuhu,Kiukiang,Nanchang,Shangsha,Shasi,Ichang.Onewent to Kaifeng in Honan,and another to Yung Ching in Chili,and still.anotherThese libraries usually made up of lotsof 100 books or more.travelledtoPeping.

Sometimes they contain all Chinese books, sometimes all English books,and sometimes half English and half Chinese.For the law school she tried to include asmany books relating to law as possible;and for the agrieultural school,booksreleting to agrieulture. The difficulty she has experienced in carrying on thiswork has been to find suitable books in Chinese on these subjects.:They havenot been translated,or if so,the translation isoften a poor one,One of thegreatestneeds in the educational world in China to.day are books on up-to-date scienitifcsocial and political subjects,and inspiring biographies,Literature for youngpeoplewhich make the lives of children in America and Europe so full of joy,is also sadlylacking.As she made up these libraries,she was constantly confronted with theseDeeds.However she never ceased her effor to reach out and carry the influenceof books to the students gathered in our midst,though most of the work has beenslow,gradual and decidedly p-hill,withone exception-thepublilecture courseAs the workin the Boone Library grew,tecinical training became necessaryWith the support of friends in.the Church at home, Miss Wood sent Mr. SamuelSeng as the first student from China to America for library training,and MrThomas C.S.Hu three years later.Immediately upon the return of Mr. Sengmittee, Y.M.C.A. Shanghai,in order.that、a demonstrated lecture on the Needlibrary idea far afield:as these lectures demonstrated with apparatus were givenin fourteen cities in China.The next vision that came to MissWood was fo sarta library schoolatBoone for thetraining ofyoungmen for library servicein thisland ofours.Thisplan was heartily endorsed by Bishop-Gilman, then President of the University1930, with a class of six students who have since been known as The HappySix'.They have established fine records of service in their careers as librariansThe work Miss Wood has done through the Library School-now the only one inChina-is far reaching, because the School is graduating.young men and youngwomen everyyearin modernmethods of library work,and these graduates are overChina,holding responsible positions in libraries. Though the School has but ashort history of ten years,yet fhe influence these graduntes exert is very great.In 1926 MissWood took amost significant stepwhich proved to:beofnational importance.That was her lobbying in Washington for the benefit of our

remitted by the United States,portion of it be used to introduce certain modelsof the public library in China.A petition was therefore drawn up,embodyingthis idea,which was sent tothe President of the United States after she hadsucceeded in securing 150 endorsers,including leading statesmen,prominenteducators,aud business men who attached their signatures to this document.Inorder that the Bill might go through the American Congress,Mis Wood volunteer-ed to go to Washington and work forits passage. She remained there for fivemonths and saw praetically all the Senators and Congressmen. The Bill passedbyalargemajority.In order to impress upon the members of tlie China Foundation for theProustion of Edcuation and Culture,entrusted with the administration of thisreturned indemnity， the importance of miodern public libraries,the AmericanLibrary Association with n meinbership of 6,000 was requested to send a.repre-sentative to make a survey.American friendsof the Boone Library, throughthe efforts and infuence of Miss Wood,financed this mission.Dr.Arthur E.Bostwick,Librarian of St.Louis Public Library,twice President of the Associa-tion,agreat anthority on the American Library system and author of many bookson library science, was chosen to come to China to survey the field and advise inplanningand organizing these modern public libraries.The coming of thisdelegate meant the launching of a National Library Movement.This has grownoutof Miss Wood's effort,the Boone Library which started in such a humble way，has slowly but steadily gone forward year by year,little by little，until theopportunity came to takea national step,which wields an influence throughoutthe whole Country.The magnificent library,now called the National Libraly ofPeping,situated in the Palace,is the result of her faith and labor.And it ishoped,as years go by， that other libraries will follow.The same Foundationseeing the need of library training,and recoguizing the work done by theBoone Library School,was prompted to make an annual grant to this School tofurther the work.From now on we must struggle anew to hold this privilege,as other libraries under the Government,better equipped than the Boone Library,willseekthisgrant.made herself fit forhis workby studying at different times,while on furlough,inPratt,and Simons College,getting instructions from such competent teachers asMiss Plummer,Miss Rathbone,Miss Howe,and Miss Donnelly.Her interest in

the library movement in China brought wouderful results:The Boone Libraryand its many travelling libraries, and public reading rooms the Boone LibrarySchool which boasts of her eighty upwards of graduates serving in many places athome and abroad; the coming of Dr. Bostwick to China and the subsequentestablishment of the National Library Association and the opening of the NationalLibrary of Peping,and the formation of the China Foundation for the Promotionof Education and Culture, one of whose projects is the advancement of librarywork in China.By these fruits.weknow the tree.After reading the above account of the great life of a marvelous woman,though andinadequate incomplete it may seem,one will certainly question how shementioned it once. We know just this much. She prayed a gteat dealevery day.She asked God for help when she felt weak and herself unequal to the task set.Whatever joy or grief she had, she let God know of it. She prayed for God’scounsel before launching any big plans.In asking for constributions for thesite,and putting up the library building,and furnishing it,and in asking for giftsfor books and periodicals from Women's Auxiliaries, the Church PeriodicalClub,etc.,and for support to further her library work in China from year toyear,she wrote thousands and thousands of letters. The reams of paper she has thusconsumed would certainly fill the whole libraryl Is shenot justified to be calledby the above title-the Queen of the Modern Library Movement?She certainlydeserves this honor,and will long be remembered as such,even though she haspassed away.When Hans Christian Andersen died, they said of him:Hans isnot dead,he will live forever in the hearts of children.We may well say of MissWood:Miss Wood is not dead,she willlive forever in the hearts of the Chinesepeople.'x
