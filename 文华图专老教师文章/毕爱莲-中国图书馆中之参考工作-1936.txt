Introducing ReferenceService to China.
E.E.Booth
Reference work in the libraries of China has possiblities ofwider development.In fact this service is too litle known orun-derstood.Ihave been asked:"What does reference work offer? The librarian cannet be ato know fully subjects outside his own field. He is not an engineerto explain such things as¡°hydraulics'.or¡®refrigeration'¡±Phis istrue. He cannot. But he can assist the reader in finding the booksources of all minute points related to these highlv specialized suhjects.And Howis what I might brieflv try to point out Forreference service is expressive of forethought and guidance.First of all,how may Reference Service be defined? It is thatservice of aiding students, scholars,and the general public in theiruse of such book tools (of learning£©as. may be called encyclopedic.These collect,according to the specially classified scope each bookor set of volumes,all possible informative material. And Referencework for the librarian is not being filled with the contents of eachvolume in his library,but having a mental note for the possiblesource of every type of ephemoral subject.Reference work to putquestion,recognizing accurately its correct relationship,sometimesconsidering especially a definite point of view,to some main subject.By a knowledge of the type of content of each reference book,he

cah quickly indicate to the puzzled reader whichofthesebooks willtreat the answer to his question most satisfactorily.Such definitions as I have given are best clurified by a fewexamples:At a recent social discumsion the subject of hypnotism was ofinterest.Some one raised the question:"What is the difference in meaning between hypnotism andmesmerism?"And on noting the fact that¡®mesmerism'is a word derivedfrom the nnme ofa doctor who practised thispowerasa means ofanesthesia before the use of ether was given to surgical cases,onewished to know:survey of historic and cultural developments at that time?Again, as soon as the subject of modern surgery and anesthesiawas introduced it was realized that there are many kinds of ether."Which is used for this purpose?"Three different source books of rather a special nature answerthese three questions. The time of the inquirer can be saved if thelibrariun has the correct suggestion formed from his judgment ofalso,of course,on hissuch key phrases as are underlined-basedknowledge of these sourcebooks.Such questions may be considered mere points of idle curiosity£¬but again they may be questions thatarise in the preparation ofato check,or verify,as rapidly and efficiently as possible.Hecannot be expected to know the full resources of the library£¬and itis the librarian who can indicate the way.

Just yesterday a girl was searching for current articles onleadership,in preparation ofa graduation paper.Just a monthago the American Church Mission Lentin Study class asked for abibliography of non-official publications on the subject of their study,Mexico. They were further interested in checking up on such que-stions as ¡°What was the Monroe Doctrine in relation to Mexico?¡±"Where is there an outline of the Six Year Plan and when wasit adopted?¡±¡°Where is there a list of the presidents of Mexico?¡±Such information cannot readily be filled for readers,yet sourcesare definitely in the librarian's field.So far in most Chinesee libraries questions are few-but that isbecause readers have not been made conscious of the service at hand.There is no reason why this should remain so.Years ago therewas no knowledge of the fact that electricity could be harnessedandproduce a lighting service for the world.But that did notmean that once Edison perfected his invention that electric lightingshould persistently be refused,or ignored,its great service notrecognized just because its need and use was not known in cen-turies past!
